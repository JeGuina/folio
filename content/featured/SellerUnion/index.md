My most favorite website built for a client to date. All functions and layout was built from scratch. It's designed as a blogging website but emulates Facebook's friend system, private messaging, and community system. No website builder / theme was used to build it. It uses custom hooks and filters that will make some plugins work outside of their default theme.
